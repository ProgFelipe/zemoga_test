## Architecture
Clean architecture used in this app which objective is the separation of concerns.

As well the usage of Single Activity architecture with android Jetpack navigation.

Overview of application layers

**1.) Presentation Layer**: Where all the UI happens.
  
  | UI | Description |
  | ------ | ------ |
  | HomeFragment | which contains the `ViewPager` with `PostsFragment and FavoriteFragment`. |
  | PostDetailFragment | that gets the `id` of selected post as argument and display the post details. |
  | PostsViewModel | a shared viewModel that refresh views using LiveData |

**2.) Domain Layer**: The UseCase is present here which contains the business rules.

The reason why I choose these libraries is because I consider that they are currently a standard provided by `Google`, for example the case of `Jetpack`, which provides libraries that encapsulate behaviors such as `navigation` or dependency injection with `Hilt` as an evolution of `Dagger` and also I have an recent affinity with some of these libraries as is the case of `Rx`.
